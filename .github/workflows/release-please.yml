    # no one ever told me this about release-please so I will leave it here:
    # release-please runs in one of two states:
    # 1. "changes detected on main branch -> create a release PR with bumped version and changelog"
    # 2. "release PR was merged -> create a release and tag on GitHub"
    #     - you can use the outputs of the release-please step to conditionally run other steps/jobs like building and publishing which should only run in state #2 (see the "build-and-publish" job below)
