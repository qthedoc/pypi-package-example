name: Release Please

# This workflow automatically tests, builds, releases, and publishes our package.
# For maximum understanding there are lots of comments!

# Overview of workflow:
# 1. test: runs on both PRs and pushes to main, but ideally only runs once per change (either on the PR or on the push after merge, but not both)
# 2. release-please: runs only on pushes to main, creates release PRs when changes are detected and creates releases when release PRs are merged
# 3. build: runs only when a release PR is merged, builds distribution files and uploads them as release assets and workflow artifacts
# 4. publish: runs only when a release PR is merged, publishes the built distribution files to PyPI (currently configured to publish to Test PyPI)

# Understanding release-please...
# no one ever told me this about release-please so here it is:
# release-please runs in one of two states:
# 1. "changes detected (on main branch) -> create a 'release PR' with bumped version and changelog. You review the 'release PR' and merge it when you're ready to release"
# 2. "release PR was merged -> create a release and tag on GitHub"
#     - you can use the outputs of the release-please step to conditionally run other steps/jobs like building and publishing which should only run in state #2 (see the "build-and-publish" job below)


# I think this is a great workflow because while it contains all 4 jobs, each job only gets run when needed, here is the flow:
# 1. Create a PR with changes: test runs on the PR, nothing else.
# 2. Merge the PR: test runs again on the push to main, release-please detects changes and creates a release PR, build and publish do not run because the release-please job does not create a release in this workflow run (it just created a release PR)
# 3. Merge the release PR: test runs again on the push to main, release-please detects that the release PR was merged and creates a release, build and publish jobs run

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]           # run for PRs targeting main (this also re-runs for any commits to the PR branch after the PR is opened, which is nice for testing changes to the PR)
  push:
    branches: [main]           # run on direct pushes to main
